# Console Finances - George Oustapasidis    


## Description

In this project, our objective was to write a JS (JavaScript) code file, which will analyze the records within the dataset which contains a large array. within the array the two fields are Date and Profits.  

Our project has to showcase our ability to calculate :

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

This will showcase the ability to tackle a real-life situation which our skills can come handy.
